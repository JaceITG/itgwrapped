ITG Wrapped is a fun way to interpret and share statistics about your ITG/Stepmania performance from the past year!

This project was inspired by the intuitive, stylish analytics of applications like Spotify. We love numbers.

Visit the [ITG Wrapped](https://jaceitg.github.io/itgwrapped/) site to make yours now, or view a [demonstration](https://jaceitg.github.io/itgwrapped/#/demo) using my own Stats file if you don't have one!
